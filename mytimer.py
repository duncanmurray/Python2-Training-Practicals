This user written module contains a simple mechanism for
timing operations from Python.  It contains two functions,
start_timer(), which must be called first to initialise the
present time, and end_timer() which calculates the elapsed
CPU time and displays it.

>>> start_timer()
>>> end_timer()
End time    : 0.000 seconds
